# Machine-Learning
Prediction of the number of resignations in a company with supervised learning algorithms in Python with Pandas : 
The abundance of positions is a problem for companies that can prove to be very expensive.
This is why it is strategic for companies to understand the reason why they are likely to leave their positions. Our goal from this mini-project is to predict why and when employees will leave an average company using supervised learning algorithms.
